            <h1 class="display-4 app-name">SpoQ</h1>
            <p class="lead">SpoQ is an interactive music quiz application. It uses the Spotify music database, enabling you to challenge your friends on a 5-round trivia quiz of your favourite playlists. You’ll compete against your friends on who can collect the most points by guessing song titles from the prior selected playlist as fast as possible.</p>
            
            <h2 id="about">About SpoQ</h2>
            <p> There are some things to keep in mind when trying out SpoQ:
            </p>
            <li>
            You’ll need a phone running Android OS and a Spotify premium account
            </li>
            <li>
            Due to some legal issues, we can not publish SpoQ on the Google Play Store. To install the app, click the “Download SpoQ” button and open the .apk file on your phone. It will ask you to accept the “installation from an unknown source”, to complete the installation you need to make an exception for our App. This app is intended to our friends only, there are no viruses or other unpleasant things like collection of your data - just the quiz functionality! ;)
            </li>
            <li>
            After signing up, swipe right and add a friend. Try searching for “niko” or “Andreas” to challenge one of us! Afterwards, click the Play against friend button on the main page.
            </li>
            <li>
            Please be patient after selecting the friend you want to play against, this step needs some time as the App will connect to your Spotify App during this stage. Before your first game, you’ll be asked by Spotify to accept some conditions - you need to accept those to play the quiz. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>
            This is our first project and due to the legal issues with Spotify we will not continue developing SpoQ. Still we wanted to make it available for our friends and other people interested in the project via this webpage. As the development was stopped, it might not always work as intended and can possibly crash in some situations. Just restart the app and feel free to give us feedback on the situation! :)
